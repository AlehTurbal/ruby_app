# Ruby App

###
Ruby script `parser.rb` reads log file and returns:
 - list of webpages with most page views ordered from 
most pages views to less page views
 - list of webpages with most unique page views also 
ordered

### Highlights
- 100% coverage
- TDD development
- OO approach

### Testing
- run `rspec`


### To run app:

- Execute `chmod +x parser.rb`
- Run `./parser.rb <path-to-log-file>`

### What could be improved
- Add log file validation
- Add log line validation
- Improve calculation performance by using DB
